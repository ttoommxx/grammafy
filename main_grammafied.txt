ciao come stai

questo dovrebbe funzionare

[1]
and this is the end

come stau?

[1],

e domani mangiamo lapastaasciutto

[1]
[1]

again! 

the beginning of the theorem  here
Theorem.
I want to show that [1]

Proof.
because [1] then [1]. â– 


NOW WE DO SOMETHING ELSE.

ciao! Now let's try  two different equations

first with the double dollar
[1],
did it work?

[1], is this now working?? 
 want to write something in red Color:RED MOLTO ROSSO 



- pasta
- asciutta

- carrots

Next, construct a sequence [1] and [1] in the following way. Suppose that [1] has been defined with [1]. Let [1] and using the same argument as before we find [1] and [1] such that
[1],
where [1]. Now let [1]. Then
[1].

Let [1]. Notice that the same argument as in Francos implies that [1] is differentiable a.e. and [1] (in particular in [1]). We only have to prove that [1]. The trick is the following: we simply evaluate
[1].

Color:RED DRAFT

We need to enrich the above construction by asking that, at each [1],
[1]
as well, for some universal constant [1]. But because we can control the integral over the initial terms, as we have to prove is that there is [1] independent on [1] and [1] (Color:RED but if depends on [1] is still fine for [1], we just lose the bound) such that
[1]
